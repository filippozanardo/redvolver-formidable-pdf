## Get started

Download the file or clone the repository and activate the plugin.
In each entry now there is a link called PDF to download the pdf.

In every email now there is also attached the generated PDF.

At the moment for create a link to download/generate the PDF just use:

```
http://yoursite.url/?rvpdf=1&formid=x&entryid=xx
```

Replace formid with your form id and entryid with your entryid or copy and paste the url of the PDF button in entries.
